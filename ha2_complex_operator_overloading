//Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type
//Implement the following operations : 1. Constructor(including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0 + 0i).
//2. Overloaded operator+ to add two complex numbers. 
//3. Overloaded operator* to multiply two complex numbers. 
//4. Overloaded << and >> to print and read complex Numbers

//imp to have 2 constructors
//2 ways
//create all as friend functions and overload operators accordingly
//or have + , * not as friend but done in class itself.

//friend ostream &operator(ostream &out,complex &c)
//Pass everytime by reference only for istream and ostream

//friend complex operator + (complex c1,complex c2)
//no need of reference. just pass both the objects
