// 1.oop.calc.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//
//Write a C++ program to create a calculator for an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, / )
//The program shud take 2 operands from user and performs the operation on
//those two operands depending upon the operator entered by user.
//Use a switch statement to select the operation.
//Finally, display the result.Some sample interaction with the program might look like this:
//Enter first number, operator, second number : 10 / 3 Answer = 3.333333
//Do another(y / n) ? y Enter first number, operator, second number : 12 + 100 Answer = 112 
//Do another(y / n) ? n

//Pretty straightforward
//Important to write the 2 operands as floats
